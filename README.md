# Iron Skillet
The purpose of the Iron Skillet project is to provide a repository of XML configuration snippets that may be used to secure a Palo Alto Networks NGFW in accordance with our best practice recommendations.  These configuration snippets can be easily loaded into a firewall or Panorama minimizing configuration time to reducing errors.

The template details and usage are documented at:

[Iron Skillet Documentation](https://iron-skillet-test.readthedocs.io/en/panos_v8.1/)

## Getting Started
Prior to utilizing these XML configuration snippets is important to familiarize yourself with the best practice recommendations for Internet Gateway, Datacenter, Wildfire, L4-L7 evasions and other use cases.

[Best Practice Recommendations](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/best-practices)

While useful as suggestions and recommendations, the user is still required to manually use the GUI or CLI to configuration each recommendation.

## Download
To download these configuration snippets simply clone this repo with the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet.git

## Deployment
Loading the XML configuration snippets can be done using a variety of methods.
